Project Title:
“Underrated Tunes”

Project Overview:
“Underrated Tunes” is a platform where users can discover and rate songs that are widely considered underrated or underappreciated. The project’s purpose is to showcase lesser-known music gems that might not have received mainstream attention, allowing music lovers to explore hidden treasures across various genres. It aims to create a community of users who share and promote songs that they feel deserve more love.

Key Features:
Song Discovery Feed – A daily updated list of underrated songs from different genres, showcasing tracks with fewer streams or less recognition.
User Submissions – Users can submit their favorite underrated songs, complete with descriptions and reasons why the song is special.
Voting System – Users can vote on songs to help them get ranked and noticed by other listeners.
Genre Filters – Explore underrated songs by genre, mood, or theme to help users find new tracks based on their personal preferences.
Community Reviews – Users can write reviews or short thoughts on songs, creating a space for interaction and discussion around the tracks.
Weekly Spotlight – A weekly feature that highlights the most underrated song of the week based on user votes and reviews.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js for dynamic user interfaces and fast performance.
Backend: Node.js with Express for creating RESTful APIs to handle user submissions, voting, and song data.
Database: MongoDB for flexible, schema-less storage of songs, user submissions, and votes.

Why This Project:
I’ve chosen this project because I’m passionate about music discovery and want to create a space where lesser-known artists or tracks get the attention they deserve. It’s a chance to build something that not only helps people explore new music but also gives them a sense of contributing to the discovery process. The project will help me develop full-stack web development skills, particularly in creating a dynamic, interactive user interface and building scalable APIs. Additionally, I’ll gain experience in data modeling, handling user-generated content, and implementing voting systems to build engagement within the community.
